# Git concepts

* branching - branching strategy helps you paralelize work
* local vs remote
* clone - making a copy of a current repository, essentially if gets the latest version and maps that folder to that source
* pull - gets the latest version for that branch
* add - adds a modified file or folder to staged status, waiting to be commited
* commit - create a commit onto your local branch
* push - sync your local branch to remote
* pull request - request to merge your code back which includes in code review and maybe approval into the process
